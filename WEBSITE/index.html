    <h2>Background 📚</h2>
    <p>
      I did my first 3 years of university at <strong>Sup de co Dakar</strong> in Pge. I received my bachelor's degree and then I enrolled in the mobility program at <strong>Bem Dakar</strong> , a subsidiary school of <strong>Kedge business school</strong> , so I did my master 1 in Dakar and currently I'm doing my master 2 in <strong>Kedge business school</strong>  in Bordeaux.

    <h2>Professional Background 🗃📋</h2>
    <p>
      I did a 3 month internship in accounting at imperial tobacco, which allowed me to discover that finance was not really what I was good at. Then I did a 4 months internship in marketing, in Gambia. I liked it and that's the reason why I'm doing the training I'm doing now.

    <h2>Strengths and individual qualifications 💪</h2>
    <p>
      I have a creative mind; I am good at coming up with new concepts. I am dynamic, determined and I adapt quickly to unpredictable situations. But I am a perfectionist, which tends to delay my projects.
      I have the photoshop qualification and I am currently preparing the Google analytic certification. .
